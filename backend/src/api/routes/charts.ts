// Daily BEAM/USD closing price from oracle snapshots.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Market cap in USD per day: circulating supply x that day's closing BEAM/USD.
//
// Supply has no history anywhere in the system - `assets.emission` for aid 0 is
// a single mutable column, rewritten in place by services/beamSupply.ts from
// the explorer's /status, which takes no height. So it is derived from height,
// which `block_metrics` does have per day, through services/beamEmission.ts.
//
// The multiplication happens in JS rather than in the query because the
// emission schedule is not a smooth curve: the miner reward truncates on an
// integer shift and the treasury arrives in 60 monthly bursts, and the closed
// form that fits both in SQL is measurably wrong in the middle - up to 0.48%
// during treasury vesting, which covers everything before January 2024. See
// beamEmission.ts.
//
// The series starts where `oracle_snapshots` does (Aug 2022), not at genesis:
// there is no price before that to multiply by.
//
// The `bridge-tvl` series is derived the same way, for the same reason:
// `bridge_escrow` is one row per bridge rewritten in place (migration 045 calls
// it "a 'current value' gauge, not a time series"), so its history is
// reconstructed from `bridge_messages` flow plus Pipe Funds deltas, anchored to
// the current snapshot. See services/bridgeTvl.ts.
